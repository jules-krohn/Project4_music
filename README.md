# Project4_music

For Project 4, the group decided to build a music recommendation algorithm using the last.fm song dataset. 

The Dataset:
The dataset is a library of networking, tagging, and music artist listening information from over 2,0000 users of the last.fm music system. The csv files we used were organized as:
* A list of artists with a unique ID and url to their page on last.fm
* A list of user-given tags (many were genre, some were the general mood or thought about the artist), each with a unique ID
* A list of user-artist pairs and a "weight", which is the number of times a user listened to that artist
* A list of tag assignments assigned to each artist by each user


The Model:
